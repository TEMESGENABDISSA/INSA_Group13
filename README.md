# FAYDA Verification Platform

A web platform that allows registered companies and institutions to verify individuals using the Ethiopian National ID (FAYDA) system.
---

# 💡 Project Purpose
Companies and institutions often issue their own IDs, which creates duplication and inefficiencies. This system eliminates the need for separate company-issued IDs by using **FAYDA (National ID)** as the primary verification method.
